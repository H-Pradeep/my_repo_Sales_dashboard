# my_repo_Sales_dashboard
Elevating data visualization expertise, this Power BI project seamlessly transforms intricate sales data into a dynamic and insightful dashboard. With a focus on revenue, sales, discount, and gross margin, the dashboard offers a comprehensive snapshot of business performance, empowering strategic decision-making. This project showcases my proficiency in translating raw data into compelling visual narratives for enhanced business analysis.

Data Exploration: Initially data exploration is done to understand the data and also to check if there are any gaps. As and when new years sales data is added into sales folder, a mechanism is created to load all the new files in the folder upon refresh.

Data Modelling: Ensured the data's accuracy and consistency by cleaning it up in Power Query. Using Power Query, I added extra columns (such as splitting columns, adding index columns to link tables) to the data, giving more details for a better analysis. For tracking time-based trends, crafted a date table with calculated columns and established key performance indicators (KPIs) using DAX. Established relationships among tables using star schema for data modelling.

Data Visualization: Designed various visuals to help stakeholders grasp important sales insights through KPIs, waterfall charts, and stacked column charts. These visuals offer a clear and concise presentation of key information, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and analyze sales performance. The inclusion of KPIs enhances the focus on critical metrics, while the waterfall and stacked column charts provide visual representations of sales trends and comparisons. This approach ensures effective communication of key sales data to stakeholders. (Link to live Dashboard:https://www.novypro.com/project/sales-dashboard-235)
